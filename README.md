# ITMR
Idiots Turing Machine Redux

This progect is a esolang heavily based in Brainfuck and in my other esolang ITM. exept now better writen, with only the bare minum features. with a more unique apeal to it
Please use the TDM-GCC compiler (on 32 bit mode) to compile from C to a executable. i havent tested yet but it should be linux compatible aswell
